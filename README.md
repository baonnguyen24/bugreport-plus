# BugReport+

A professional-grade **bug tracking and QA workflow application** demonstrating a full-stack architecture with a strong **Test-First** mindset.

BugReport+ integrates a modern React (Tailwind) frontend with a Spring Boot backend, protected by a robust Playwright E2E testing suite and backend integration tests.

## 🚀 Overview

BugReport+ is designed with quality as a first-class citizen. While the application provides a clean UI for reporting and managing bugs, the core value lies in its **testing infrastructure, architecture, and scalability**.

### Tech Stack:

**- Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, Firebase Auth/Firestore

**- Backend**: Spring Boot, Java 21, PostgreSQL (Production / Local), H2 (Testing)

**- Quality Assurance**: Playwright (E2E & UI Testing), JUnit 5, MockMvc (Backend Integration Testing)
